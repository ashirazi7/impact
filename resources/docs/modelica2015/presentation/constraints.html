<h1>Constraints</h1>

<h3 class="c-step">
  Currently, we take the constraints specified by a library literally
  (<i>i.e.,</i> the current definition of the <code>uses</code>
  annotation specifies that each version of a library can only be
  compatible with a single version of any other library)
</h3>

<h3 class="c-step">
  It would be good if, in the future, Modelica allowed multiple
  candidates to be used via the <code>uses</code> annotation.
</h3>

<h3 class="c-step">
  Eventually, we'd like to move to a more "rational" approach where
  semantic versioning was taken into account when determining
  constraints.
