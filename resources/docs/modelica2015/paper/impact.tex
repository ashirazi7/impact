\abstract{

  This paper discussed the \code{impact} package manager.  The primary
  goal of this project is to support the development of a healthy
  eco-system around Modelica.  For many other languages, the existance
  of an easy to use package manager has made it easier for people to
  explore and adopt those languages.  We seek to bring that same kind
  of capability to the Modelica community by incorporating useful
  features from other package managers like \code{bower}, \code{npm},
  \it{etc}.

  This paper is an update on the status of the \code{impact} package
  manager which was discussed previously in \cite{}.  This latest
  version of \code{impact} involves a complete rewrite that
  incorporates a more advanced dependency resolution algorithm.  That
  dependency resolution will be discussed in depth along with many of
  the subtle issues that arose during the development of this latest
  version of impact.  Along with a superior dependency resolution
  scheme, the new version of \code{impact} is much easier to install
  and use.  Futhermore, it includes many useful new features as well.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

The motivation behind the \code{impact} project is to support two
critical aspects of library development.  The first is to make it very
easy for library developers to {\em publish} their work.  The second
is, at the same time, to make it easy for library consumers to both
find and install published libraries.

We also feel it is important  to reinforce best practices with respect
to model development.   For this reason, we have  made version control
an integral  part of  our solution.   Rather than  putting users  in a
position to have  to figure out how to make  \code{impact} work with a
version control  system, we've build \code{impact}  around the version
control system.   Not only  do users not  have to find  a way  to make
these technologies work together,  \code{impact} actually nudges those
not using  version control  toward solutions that  incorporate version
control.  In this way, we hope to demonstrate to people the advantages
of both \code{impact} and version control and establish both as ``best
practices'' for model development.

By creating a tool that makes it easy to both publish and install
libraries, we feel we are creating a critical piece of the foundation
necessary to establish a {\bf health ecosystem} for model development.

\subsection{History}

Earlier, we mentioned that \code{impact} has been completely
rewritten.  In fact, the very first version of \code{impact} was just
a single Python script for indexing and installing Modelica
code\cite{https://gist.github.com/xogeny/fac3ea9174e74275e7fe}.  It
eventually involved into a multi-file package that could be installed
using the Python package management tools.

\section{Requirements}

After building the original Python version, we gave some thought to
what worked and what didn't work well.  One issue we ran into almost
immediately was the complexity of installing the Python version of
\code{impact}.  Python is unusual in that it has two package managers,
\code{easy\_install} and \code{pip}.  It comes with
\code{easy\_install}, but \code{pip} is the more capable package
manager.  So in order for someone to install \code{impact}, they first
needed to install Python, then install \code{pip} and then install
\code{impact}.  This was far too complicated.  So we wanted to come up
with a way for people to install \code{impact} {\bf as a simple
  executable} without any runtime or prerequisites.

Another issue we ran into with the Python version was the fact that
there are two different and incompatible versions of Python being used
today.  Trying to support both was an unnecessarily inefficient use of
resources.  For this reason, we felt we needed to move away from
Python altogether.

We also had some difficulties in the Python version with support for
SSL under Windows \cite{issue}.  Because we were doing lots of
``crawling'' (more on this shortly), we needed a platform that
provided {\bf solid HTTP client support}.

Although most users Modelica run their development tools and
simulations under Windows, there are several tools that support OSX
and Linux as well as Windows.  So as to not neglect users of those
tools and to support more cross-platform options, we also wanted to be
able to {\bf compile impact for all three major platforms}.

Furthermore, we wanted to provide a simple executable for all
platforms without having to have actual development machines for each
of these different platforms.  For this reason, {\bf cross
  compilation} between different platforms was an important
consideration was well.

Of course, we also wanted to have {\bf good performance}.  For most
package management related functions, the speed of the internet
connection is probably the biggest limitating factor.  So CPU
performance wasn't that high on the list.  But, as we shall discuss
shortly, the computational complexity of the dependency resolution
algorithm we implemented could lead to some computationally intensive
calculations for complex systems of dependencies.

For these reasons, we ultimately rewrote \code{impact} in Go.  Go is a
relatively new language from Google that stresses simplicity in
language semantics but, at the same time, provides a fairly complete
standard library.  You can think of Go as being quite similar to C
with support for extremely simple object-oriented functionality,
automatic garbage collection and language level support for CSP-based
concurrency.  With Go, we were able to satisfy all the requirements
above.
